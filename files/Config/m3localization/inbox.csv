Lose twice in a row and you'll be demoted a tier.\n\nA word of caution: Fighting battles in Blitz is exhausting. After every match, the characters who participated must recover and cannot be used for a period of time. Use <color=#fff568>BLITZ CHARGES</color> to recover your characters instantly. Earn <color=#fff568>BLITZ CHARGES</color> in <color=#fff568>CHALLENGES</color>, <color=#fff568>MILESTONES</color>, and other parts of the game.

ID_ME_DE_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,Info and Update on How It Works
ID_ME_BO_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,"We'd like to provide some information on how characters are released in MARVEL Strike Force. Generally, a new character makes their debut as the main prize in Blitz mode. At the same time, that hero is made available for purchase in the Featured Character Orb. Once the Blitz ends, the character is added to the Ultimus Orb. After some time, the character is added to the Premium Orb. Finally, the character is added to a campaign node, a store, an orb, etc. This is the usual path for our characters but does not apply to all of them. Characters released through events, such as Deadpool, may be released through other game modes.\n\nBlack Panther, Doctor Strange, and Vision are the first characters to go through this process and have been added to the Ultimus Orb.\n\nThank you for playing MARVEL Strike Force!\n--MARVEL Strike Force Dev Team"

The full list of changes can be found below:\n\n- The <color=#fff568>beta and launch brackets</color> have been merged.\n- A <color=#fff568>beginners' bracket</color> has been introduced to help new players ease into Blitz mode. Players in the beginners' bracket will compete under a different reward structure.\n- The Points Multiplier scales more rapidly with each successive tier, making it easier to reach later milestones.\n\nThe <color=#fff568>rank and milestone reward structures</color> have been adjusted to accommodate these changes:\n\n- Additional character shards have been added to Milestone rewards.\n- Additional rank reward buckets have been added.\n- Since we have increased the frequency at which we reward <color=#fff568>Mega Orb Fragments</color> (in Blitz and other modes), we have reduced the quantity of fragments that can be earned from rank rewards.\n- The number of points required to qualify for rank rewards has increased.\n\nWe hope you enjoy these changes!

ID_ME_DE_DEVBLOG_101718,"Oct. 26, 2018"
ID_ME_BO_DEVBLOG_101718,"The Brotherhood of Mutants has arrived.\n\nMystique has brought her infiltration skills to S.T.R.I.K.E. and is available in the Villains Campaign. Sabretooth, Juggernaut and Pyro are next. Magneto himself, the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants, arrives in early December. To unlock Magneto you'll need to deploy Brotherhood and X-Men characters in a Legendary Event.\n\nMagneto turns the Brotherhood of Mutants into a tier one team capable of facing off against Nick Fury and his Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in Arena. Magneto is powerful in his own right, but activates a variety of powerful synergy bonuses in the Brotherhood.\n\nElsewhere in the multiverse, S.T.R.I.K.E. Commanders have begun to assault the Dark Dimension. While many Commanders are making excellent progress, we've identified and banned a number of players who were cheating. We will continue to monitor the mode and ban cheaters as needed. Fear the Darkness unlocks soon and will be an even greater challenge. Those who conquer this mode will gain access to Ultron, the most powerful character yet!\n\nYou will soon be able to collect Red Stars to promote any gold stars you have for a character to red, with each Red Star providing a multiplier to the character's overall Power. Red Stars are gained from the (cleverly named) Red Star Orb, which drops a random star promotion for a random character.\n\nWe're making one more upgrade in the upcoming release; you'll now have the ability to save squads in most game modes. This means that you don't have to hand-select teams every time in modes such as Raids and Blitz.\n\nFull details can be accessed on the MARVEL Strike Force website.\n\n-MARVEL Strike Force Dev Team"

ID_ME_NA_DEVBLOG8,Brotherhood of Mutants
ID_ME_DE_DEVBLOG8,"Nov. 6, 2018"
ID_ME_BO_DEVBLOG8,"Hello Commander,\n\nBelow you'll find an overview for the Brotherhood, as well as the upcoming events where you can recruit each member.\n\n<color=#fff568>Brotherhood of Mutants Primer</color>\nIf you're looking for a well-rounded offense, the Brotherhood of Mutants is the team for you. \n\n<color=#fff568>Mystique</color>\nA shape-shifting infiltrator, Mystique disrupts opposing strategies by copying positive effects and using her anti-stealth abilities. Acquire the stealth saboteur in the Villains 5-6 Campaign Node. \n\n<color=#fff568>Juggernaut</color>\nThe tank to end all tanks, Juggernaut possesses a very potent Taunt, and he gains power over time via his Charge. Three big ways to acquire the big bad Protector: Juggernaut Offer with the 2.1 update, Juggernaut's Event Campaign beginning soon, and the Juggernaut Raid - Launching a few days after the Event Campaign. \n\n<color=#fff568>Pyro</color>\nThe human flamethrower does a lot of damage-over-time in combat. Pyro also blocks and removes positive effects, making him a nuisance for enemies. There are four events that will fan the flames: two Pyro Blitz events and a Pyro offer in November, and his Event Campaign in January. \n\n<color=#fff568>Sabretooth</color>\nA durable Brawler, Sabretooth makes mincemeat out of anyone that Taunts in a battle. Sabretooth's Event Campaign is coming later this year after Magneto's first run. If you can't wait, Sabretooth is currently in the Premium Orb. \n\n<color=#fff568>Magneto</color>\nThe leader of the Brotherhood is effective alone, with Area of Effect control and damage abilities, but he's also a powerful ally--boosting the stats and abilities of every other Brotherhood member. Magneto will soon be available in the Asteroid M Legendary Event.\n\nTeam Synergy: With Magneto in the picture, the Brotherhood is an intimidating team with a vast array of synergies. \n\n<color=#fff568>Asteroid M</color>\nThe event everyone's been waiting for: the arrival of Magneto. This epic event requires X-Men and Brotherhood characters, meaning Wolverine, Storm, Mystique, Juggernaut, Sabretooth, and Pyro are invited to the party. You'll need your team of five at 5 Stars to unlock Magneto, one of the most powerful characters in MARVEL Strike Force. \n\nIf you miss out on Magneto this time around, don't worry. We'll have another Magneto event early next year. \n\nFull details can be accessed on the MARVEL Strike Force website. \n\n- MARVEL Strike Force Dev Team"

ID_ME_NA_REDSTARS,Introducing: Red Stars
ID_ME_DE_REDSTARS,Give your characters a Power boost!
ID_ME_BO_REDSTARS,"<color=#fff568>What are Red Stars?</color>\nRed Stars are a valuable, new way to power up your characters. Each Red Star multiplies the Power of your character by increasing all core stats: Damage, Health, Armor, Focus, and Resistance.\n\n<color=#fff568>How do Red Stars work?</color>\nRed Star Promotions are items that only drop from Red Star Orbs (which contain Red Star Characters from Level 1-7) and Elite Red Star Orbs (which contain Red Star Characters from Level 4-7).\n\nOnce you pull a Red Star Promotion, it gets applied to its corresponding character. Unlike Premium Orbs, where you earn character shards that you accumulate to Unlock and Rank Up characters, Red Star Orbs will award players with full character boosts, with boosts ranging from 1 Red Star to 7 Red Stars that are immediately applicable.\n\nOnce you get a Red Star Character, you will immediately be able to apply the number of Red Stars to the character that is equal to or less than the total number of Gold Stars you have for that character.\n\n<color=#fff568>Where do you get Red Stars?</color>\nYou can find Red Stars and Red Star Orbs in the following locations:\nThe Red Star Tutorial\n7-Day Calendar\nRed Star Blitz\nRecurring offers\n\nFor all the details on Red Stars, check out the MARVEL Strike Force Website!"
